**Q: What's the catch?**  
A: No catch! We believe in supporting the legal community. Our revenue comes from direct applicant premium subscriptions, not attorneys.

A: Yes - you can include it as a value-add service or charge separately.

**Q: What if I have 1000+ clients?**  
A: Still unlimited! No hidden fees based on volume.

**Q: Can I customize the output?**  
A: Yes - add your firm branding, custom disclaimers, and consultation CTAs.

**Q: Is this USCIS-approved?**  
A: This is a screening tool using publicly available USCIS criteria. It's not a substitute for legal analysis, which is why we offer it free to attorneys to complement your expertise.
